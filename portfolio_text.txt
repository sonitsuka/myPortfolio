Hi, I'm Oni
Front-end Developer
based in Germany with a film production & humanities background. Specializing in building and designing phuman-centric Web Applications. Oni is a lifelong learner and cooking lover.

* ABOUT
about__description
I am a passionate/cooperative junior web developer excited to start my journey as a professional web developer. I love creating and helping others.

Made in Japan, studied humanity (History & Culture Science) and computer science in Berlin, and cultivated with a deeper understanding on React.

My aim is always to stand in the others' shoes, to find out what they are expecting, and then to offer ideas or problem solutions beyond their expectations. As an implementation, I try to build applications and the codes I write are simple and clean in order for others to easily understand.
