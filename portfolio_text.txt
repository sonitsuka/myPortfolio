I am a passionate/cooperative Junior Web Developer excited to start my journey as a professional web developer. I love creating and helping others.

Made in Japan, worked as Director and Production Manager in Tokyo, studied Computer Science and Humanity (History & Culture Science) in Berlin, and cultivated with a deeper understanding on React.

My aim is always to stand in the others' shoes, to find out what they are expecting, and then to offer ideas or problem solutions beyond their expectations. As an implementation, I try to build applications and the codes I write are simple and clean in order for others to easily understand.

Comments to review:
/* I believe that you should pay closer attention to
code indentation and semicolon consistency */

/* JavaScript guidelines suggest using camelCase for
variable and function names, e.g., calculatePrice, finalPrice */

    /* Let's not include console.log statements in production code */
    console.log("Calculating final price...");
    /* Declare the discount variable with const
    to prevent reassignment */

/* Declare getDiscount with const
to prevent reassignment, or change this to a named function */


/* This variable is unused; please remove it */

 /* What do you think about returning the value using
    a ternary operator to make the function more concise? */
